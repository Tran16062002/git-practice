About the Author
Dr. Tamar Jehuda Cohen is a doctor of immunology, inventor, entrepreneur, author, mentor, and academic lecturer in science, bioethics, and Judaic studies.
Her life was abruptly changed by a large brain aneurysm and the ensuing complex surgeries that put her at great risk of death or major disabilities.
Loss of speech, epilepsy, and terrible pain – while being major challenges for her – were all a misleading mask of cracks and fractures.
That was the way the world saw her – broken. Yet, Tamar did not let the fractures define or control her.
She has overcome tremendous challenges and turned them into steppingstones for growth and immense happiness.
